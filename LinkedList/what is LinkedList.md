# What is linked list

**Linked List** is a data structure consisting of a group of **nodes** which together **represent a sequence**. Under the simplest form,  each node is composed of a **data** and one or two(depend on the type of linked list) **reference**(s) (to the next and previous node in the sequence). 

Linked List and its variations are used as underlying data structure to implement List, Stack, Queue.



# Why we need it

As you know, we have array to restore a group of variations, but the size of the array need to be set before we use it. So it is impossible for us to add more elements. Using the linked list,you can add as many elements as your memory.



# What it should has

I prefer you to view the `linkedlist.h` .

The most important methods are add,remove and get.

You’d better test your list before committing.
